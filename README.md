Angry Birds stage 2.5 with Class Inheritance and Images

In this class I learned about the GIT and GIT HUB and some commands related to it. Such as pwd which shows the present directory in which we are working, ls which shows all the folders inside a directory and cd to open or switch to a new directory and mkdir to make a new folder, etc in the GIT BASH which i downloaded for the link for my laptop.
I also learned how to clone the githud code to a folder.
